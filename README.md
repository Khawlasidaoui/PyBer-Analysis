# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview 
The project aims to analyze rideshare data to predict and visualize trends using matplotlib and pandas libraries in python. This analysis will help compare data in different neighborhoods in order to optimize access to ride-sharing services and increase their affordability in underserved neighborhoods. 
 
## Results and Analysis
Below is a summary of number of rides, drivers, average fare/ride, average fare/driver and total fares in 3 types of neighborhoods: rural, suburban and urban.

It's clear that there's less demand for ride-sharing services as neighborhoods gradually go from urban to rural, while the average fare per driver and per ride decrease from rural to urban neighborhoods. The plot below helps visualize the data and leads to the same conclusion.

## Summary
Based on the results of the analysis, the following business recommendations can be made to the the CEO for disparities among city types:

1. Provide the option for monthly subscriptions, this could help stabilize the fares and encourages more riders in rural areas to join the service. 
2. The total number of rides could be low not only because of high average fares/ride, but a low number of available drivers in those areas could be the problem as well. A solution would be to increase the number of drivers in certain areas, their incentive could be that on average the fare/driver in those areas is currently higher than city fares. 
3. Create a points system based on number of rides: offer bonuses for drivers as well as discounts for riders in underserved areas after they reach a certain number of rides. Closing the gap between supply and demand will stabilize all the parameters and ultimately lead to an increase in total fares.
